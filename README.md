**Deploy, fine-tune, and optimize ML models using Microsoft Azure**

## What is this book about?
Data scientists working on productionizing machine learning workloads face a breadth of challenges at every step owing to the countless factors involved in getting ML models deployed and running. This book offers solutions to common issues, detailed explanations of essential concepts, and step-by-step instructions to productionize ML workloads using Azure Machine Learning Service. You’ll see how data scientists and machine learning engineers working with Microsoft Azure can train and deploy ML models at scale by putting their knowledge to work with this practical guide.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Train machine learning models in Azure Machine Learning Service
* Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
* Host machine learning models on real-time scoring endpoints
* Mitigate bias in machine learning models
* Get the hang of using an MLOps framework to productionize models
* Simplify machine learning model explainability using AMLS and Azure Interpret

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
#Does not support missing values, so using imputed ts instead
res = seasonal_decompose(ts, period=7*48, model="additive",
extrapolate_trend="freq")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Machine learning engineers and data scientists who want to move to ML engineering roles will find this AMLS book useful. Familiarity with the Azure ecosystem will assist with understanding the concepts covered.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
